Having worked as a localization game tester for 7 years, I would intend to continue working in the gaming industry. However, I noticed from several job postings and the interviews I had so far that the requirements are stricter than in the past and a deeper understanding of the game development process, from knowledge of game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine and programming, is essential. Thus, I repute this course would significantly help me to acquire these skills I'm actually lacking.
