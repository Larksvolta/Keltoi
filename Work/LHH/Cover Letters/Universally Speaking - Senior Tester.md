Dear Universally Speaking,
I am writing the following as I'm currently working in your office in Madrid and I would be interested in this position as Senior Tester.
 
I worked for 7 years as a computer technician at Karat Kitchen SRL in Arezzo, Italy. In this period, I was responsible for various tasks ranging from computer and network maintenance, 3D modelling, and translation and proofreading of price lists and catalogues. I also provided helpdesk support to our Italian and foreign customers, assisting them in the use of our kitchen planner.
 
In 2017 I started working as a Localization QA Tester for Keywords Studios in Montr√©al and then in Dublin. My previous experience at Karat Kitchen helped me significantly in this new role, allowing me to quickly gain confidence with all the testing tools (like Jira, TestRail, Hansoft and MemoQ) and platforms provided. I took part in over 40 projects where, thanks to my attention to detail and a predisposition for interpersonal relations, I became a valuable resource for the teams I was working with. In 2020 I received a promotion to Senior Tester, assuming further responsibilities like mentoring new team members, or leading other Italian testers in larger projects.
 
I'm looking for new opportunities after my role was made redundant and I believe your company would be a great place to continue my career in the game industry.
Please also note that I'm currently living in Ireland but I'm more than willing to relocate to Spain.
 
Kind regards,
Marco Fiorucci
