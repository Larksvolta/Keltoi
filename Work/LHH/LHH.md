Elena:
 maybe you can also find a way to build your education piece into how you ended up here doing this job - more of a conversation piece for the interview 🙂  
(for example, I studied japanese at universrity > started travelling here and there until I ended in Keywords, and here I am three countries later, doing little of what I studied - albeit still Language related in some way)

Language training - travelling

my role was made redundant - never put personal

working with languages is an asset

![[Pasted image 20240624140152.png]]

I worked in Keywords for 7 years as LQA Tester until my role was made redundant last month. My tasks ranged from testing the localized content of videogames and reporting any issue found, whether grammatical, implementation or compliance, mentored new team members and led a small team of Italian colleagues. My attention to detail and my proficiency with Italian and English significantly helped me succeeding in the role
