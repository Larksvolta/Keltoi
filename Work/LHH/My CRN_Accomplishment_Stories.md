**Your Accomplishments**

In today’s job market, it is important to know your skills and be able to find positions that require those skills. An excellent guide for developing accomplishment stories that showcase your skills is called SOAR. Your SOAR stories put your accomplishments in a business context that an employer can understand. The SOAR acronym is easy to remember and will help you organize material in interview situations.

_Example:_

# Describe the Situation.

Supervisor needed small database set up to automate manual records and calculate costs.

# Describe the Obstacles you faced.

Lack of knowledge in spreadsheet or database applications.

# List the Actions you took.

Took online training, asked for coaching from a colleague to set up spreadsheet.

1. **Describe the Results you helped obtain and the benefits to your employer.** Completed and used the new database in a spreadsheet format reducing record keeping and calculation time by 80% from previous manual method.

The SOAR approach works because it…

- Presents a complete story, from the context through to the results.
- Is applicable outside your industry – shows your thinking process.

You should have as many as 10-20 SOAR stories ready when you go in for an interview.

These stories are great for open-ended questions. Your accomplishments reflect your professional successes. These are actions that you took, that were a success, and for which you are very proud. Accomplishments are the best possible evidence that you can work effectively, and that you can and do use your skills to good advantage. An accomplishment is not necessarily something exceptional or spectacular. But it can reveal a lot about your talents and abilities.

To help you determine which activities could be considered accomplishments, ask yourself the following questions:
