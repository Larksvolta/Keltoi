# The Seven Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
https://www.split.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases/

- Phase 1: Planning.
- Phase 2: Requirements Analysis.
- Phase 3: Design.
- Phase 4: Coding.
- Phase 5: Testing.
- Phase 6: Deployment.
- Phase 7: Maintenance.

# **Frequent SDLC Models**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) encompasses various models that outline the processes involved in software development and maintenance. Here are seven commonly used SDLC models:

## Waterfall Model

This is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step. The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Iterative Model

This model involves repetitive cycles of development, allowing for feedback and improvement in each iteration. Phases are often repeated until the final product is achieved with success.

## Incremental Model

This is more of an incremental model that divides the system into small, manageable parts (also known as increments) with each increment representing a portion of the entire system’s functionality. In this approach, each increment is developed and delivered separately.

## Spiral Model

The spiral model incorporates elements of both iterative and incremental models. In this model, development progresses in a spiral fashion through repeating cycles of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and critical evaluation.

## V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)

Consider this an extension of the waterfall model that emphasizes the relationship between development stages and testing stages. In this model, each development stage has a corresponding testing phase.

## Agile Model

The agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. When implementing an agile model, requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and adaptation to change.

## RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)

This is not about giving fellow surfers props after riding a killer wave. Alternatively, the RAD model focuses on rapid prototyping and quick feedback from end-users. It involves user feedback and iterations to rapidly refine and enhance the software.

It’s important to note that these models are not mutually exclusive, and development teams often use a combination of methodologies tailored to the project’s specific needs. Factors such as project requirements, budget, timeline, and flexibility determine the choice of an SDLC model.
