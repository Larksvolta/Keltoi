# Idea #3 - Travel blog for game designers

1. The topic of my website would be a travel blog that could inspire game makers to build original fantasy worlds. I am an avid player of RPG videogames, but lately I find that the worlds portrayed in some games are not immersive, original or plausible. In the past I had the luck to visit places that, with their magical atmosphere and fascinating history, could be a perfect inspiration to build fantasy worlds.
2. The objective of the site is to describe the history, culture, architecture and geography of certain locations that could serve as references to designers and artists working in the gaming industry. Although there are plenty of sites and apps where a game designer could take inspiration from, like Instagram, Pinterest or Wikipedia, it's very easy to get tangled in the web. Then, I thought that a site with carefully selected locations could be fairly useful. Ideally, the users could add their locations as well, thus ideally creating a community of game developers/explorers.
3. I found two sites about location scouting:
	1. https://www.soscout.com/ is a commercial site that rents locations for photo-shooting in Ireland. I would draw inspiration from the minimalist look of the home page, but also from the way the various categories are organized. In particular, there are two options to navigate through the different locations: 
		- Location by type
		- Location by area
		Since I have in mind to list various kinds of sceneries, for instance castles, caves, churches or mountains, it would be more practical for the user to have them divided by category. I would go even further and assign to every location different tags, and to implement a search by tag.
		Moreover, as one of the intents of the site would be to create a community of travelling game artists, I would include two other categories as in soscout.com:
		- The Journal: in this site it's only a one-entry-blog, but ideally could be a list of travel stories associated to the various locations. I believe that also these shared experiences could give to the studios great ideas for their games. These could be accessed also through the other options but, as this site could have numerous locations scattered all around the world, it would be more practical to have different methods to reach them.
		- Submit a location: in this site it's only a form where people can add their location to rent, but in mine it would be the section where travellers can add their stories and pictures.
	2. https://www.locationscout.net/: the target and objectives of this site are quite similar to mine, as it's "a network for photographers and travellers". The locations are listed under the "Explore" category, which in turn is divided in the sections Popular and Map. Although in Popular there's a category called "Popular Countries", I find it quite impractical as the various countries are ordered only by the number of "photo spots". I would also implement a section where the countries are divided by continent. This site not only gives users the possibility to add their locations, but they can also create an account where they can also bookmark their favourite spots: quite important feature as in this site there are thousands of them.
