Last year I took an interest in programming and started using Unreal Engine with the idea of developing my own game. Although I built only a part of the core features, this was enough to inspire me to pursue a career in game design. I am also passionate about music and composition, and I think this greatly helped me  to enhance my creativity and attention to detail. These proved to be essential in my career as game tester - where even minor issues as truncated or overlapping text often required creative solutions - and I obtained a promotion to Senior tester 4 years ago. This experience taught me to meet tight deadlines and manage stressful situations, skills that are indispensable in a fast paced industry as the gaming one.
